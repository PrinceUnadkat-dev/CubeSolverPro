# GitHub Pages Deployment Guide

## Quick Setup

1. **Push to GitHub**: Commit and push all files to your GitHub repository
2. **Enable Pages**: Go to repository Settings → Pages → Source: "GitHub Actions"
3. **Automatic Deploy**: The workflow will build and deploy automatically on push to main

## Build Process

The application uses Vite to create a static build optimized for GitHub Pages:

```bash
# Test the build locally
npx vite build --config vite.config.github.ts

# Preview the built app
npx vite preview --config vite.config.github.ts
```

## File Structure

- `index.html` - Root entry point (required by GitHub Pages)
- `client/` - Source code and development files
- `dist/` - Built files for deployment (auto-generated)
- `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` - Automated deployment workflow
- `vite.config.github.ts` - Build configuration for static hosting
